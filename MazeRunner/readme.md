## Course 1 module 4: Maze Runner

This java class codes a simple game in which a player attempts to navigate a maze. This maze initialises with a blank grid and a single x denoting the current position. As players navigate the maze they will encounter walls and pits. They cannot pass through walled areas, but can choose to jump past pits. The maze file is not added here as it was provided by the EDX course. 

The code here serves only as reference.
